## Steps for execution:
1. Execute manage.py using the command `python3 manage.py runserver` at `/SE_Project1/sentimental_analaysis`. This runs the Django server such that we can open the webUI for the project on the browser.
2. Next, open your browser and type in `localhost:8000` in the search bar to open the webUI of the application.
3. The UI typically looks as shown below and here you have a choice between URL, file or normal text input.
