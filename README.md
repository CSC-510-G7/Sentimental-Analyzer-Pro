The Sentimental Analyzer Pro is a versatile tool that can perform sentiment analysis on different types of data, including text, audio, reviews, and news articles. Sentiment analysis is one of the fastest-growing research areas in computer science, making it challenging to keep track of all the activities in the area. In our project, we aim to achieve our goal of accurately predicting a user's sentiment by analyzing the data provided using different types of input data.

## How to use Sentimental Analyzer Pro?
### Installation
1. Clone this project:
```
git clone https://github.com/NCSU-SE-Spring2025-Group6/Sentimental-Analyzer-Pro.git 
```

2. Create a `sentimental_analysis/.env` file and add the following environment variables (at least):
```
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=...
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=...
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=...
SECRET_KEY=...
SCRAPEOPS_API_SECRET=...
```

3. Make sure you are using Python 3.10 or higher. You can get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/

4. Create a Virtual Environment 

For Windows:
```
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
```

For Linux (Ubuntu) and Mac:
```
python3.10 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
5. Add environment variable

For Windows:
```
set DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=0.0.0.0,localhost,127.0.0.1
```

For Linux (Ubuntu) and Mac:
```
export DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=0.0.0.0,localhost,127.0.0.1
```
   
6. Install dependencies for the project from the root directory of the project:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')"
```
7. Install ffmpeg (you may need to restart your terminal/IDE after this step):  
For Windows:  
```
winget install ffmpeg
```  
For Linux (Ubuntu):  
```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```  
For Mac:  
```
brew install ffmpeg
'''
brew install ffmpeg
```
8. Run Django Server migrations manage.py (Note: Make sure you are in root directory of the project.)
```
python3 .\sentimental_analysis\manage.py makemigrations
python3 .\sentimental_analysis\manage.py migrate
```
9. Run Django Server using manage.py (Note: Make sure you are in root directory of the project.) Service now can be discovered from any device in the local network.
```
python3 .\sentimental_analysis\manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
10. Next, open your browser and type in `localhost:8000` in the search bar to open the user interface of the application. You may also access the server with other device in the local network with `<host_ip>:8000`

11. To install the chrome extension, go to Chrome, then [Manage Extensions](chrome://extensions/). Make sure "Developer Mode" is enabled, and click "Load Unpacked". Select the `extension/` folder in the root directory of the project. This will load the extension into your browser. To update it simply make changes in the filesystem then click the reload button in the extension page.

Now, you are good to go.
