## Steps to run the code:
1. Execute manage.py using the command <python3 manage.py runserver> at /SE_Project1/sentimental_analaysis. This runs the Django server such that we can open the webUI for the project on the browser.
2. Next, open your browser and type in <localhost:8000> to open the webUI of the application.
3. The UI typically looks as shown below and here you have a choice between URL, file or normal text input.
