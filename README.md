## Introduction - Sentimental Analysis

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone in a piece of text, audio, or other forms of data. It involves identifying whether the sentiment expressed is positive, negative, or neutral. 

### Why is it important?
<ul>
  <li>Sentiment analysis can help businesses and organizations understand how their customers or users feel about their products, services, or experiences. </li>
  <li>Companies can gauge public opinion about their products or services, track trends, and identify emerging issues or opportunities in the market.</li>
  <li>News agencies and media companies use sentiment analysis to analyze public sentiment towards news articles or events. This helps in generating content that aligns with the interests of the audience.</li>
  <li>Sentiment analysis is used in politics to understand public sentiment towards political candidates, parties, or policies. It is also used to gauge public opinion on social issues.</li>
</ul>


The complete development was achieved using the following technologies, and it is recommended that the next set of developers who take up this project have these technologies installed and keep them running before proceeding further:
- Python3
- Django
- HTML
- CSS
- Scrapy
- Vader Analysis Tool

Although we have used HTML and CSS for the FrontEnd, the users can merge the backend logic with any of the front end frameworks they wish to use such as React, angularJS, etc.

## Why C.E.L.T.?
Different types of data sources provide diverse perspectives. An all-encompassing tool can provide a more comprehensive understanding of public sentiment.
In today's world, opinions and sentiments are expressed across various channels, including social media, customer reviews, audio recordings, and news articles. A tool that can analyze these diverse data sources offers a more accurate picture of public sentiment.
Instead of using multiple specialized tools, a single tool that can handle multiple data types is cost-effective and streamlines the analysis process.

## Steps for Execution
1. Clone this project into your system
```
git clone https://github.com/amit-99/SE_Project2.git
```
2. Make sure you are using Python 3.11 or higher
3. Intall dependencies for the project from root directory of the project:
    a. To install python library dependencies use requirements.txt 
    b. We also need install and import nltk and supporting libraries
```
cd <your_download_dir>\SE_Project2\
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords')"
```
4. Install ffmpeg:  
   For Windows:  
   ```
   winget install ffmpeg
   ```  
   For Linux (Ubuntu):  
   ```
   sudo apt install ffmpeg
   ```  
   For Mac:  
   ```
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```   
6. Run Django Server using manage.py (Note: Make sure you are in root directory of the project)
```
python .\sentimental_analysis\manage.py runserver
```
6. Next, open your browser and type in `localhost:8000` in the search bar to open the webUI of the application.5. The UI typically looks as shown below and here you have a choice between URL, file or normal text input.
7. Great!! Now you are into the application
