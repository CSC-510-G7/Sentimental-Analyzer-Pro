Upon opening the can I didn\u2019t think to unpack it into another container like a bowl and I wish I had. As I poured it into a spaghetti sauce I was combining I caught sight of a black thing dropping out of the can! Argh! Don\u2019t you hate when that happens? That\u2019s the moment that I wished I had unpacked it into my glass bowl first but I suppose it\u2019s because I have such confidence in the 365 brand that I didn\u2019t think I needed too. In reality, when we have confidence in the product we are using we often feel that confidence.\nIn any case I now had the achingly unfortunate job of looking for what I saw! If you cook, you know what that feels like. I spooned through first with the spoon I was using to stir my sauce and then I had the idea of use my slotted spoon (you know the one, lots of holes or decorations looking like holes and when you first buy it you\u2019re not quite sure what you\u2019re getting it for but maybe it looks so cool or kinda cute so you drop it into your shopping basket vowing to your self that you absolutely will find a job for it and then it sits in the drawer until you forget you actually have it? Yeah, this is why you bought that thing! Yay, right! You\u2019re finally vindicated in your intelligence and farsightedness! Well, that\u2019s what I felt anyway and it\u2019s my review so\u2026 anyway\u2026) ok so I\u2019m using that spoon and I finally find the black thing and it\u2019s a really small part of a rotten tomato. (Sigh) Well, I was disappointed because now I have to decide whether to keep going or toss the whole sauce and that\u2019s a major decision in itself because we all know how food prices have gone up SIGNIFICANTLY as we\u2019re all recovering from COVID so I finally decided to go ahead with the sauce but I\u2019m determined that if the sauce tastes weird in any way I will have to toss it out. Long story longer (you thought I was going to say \u201cshort\u201d didn\u2019t you! LOL). I finished the sauce since it was mostly done anyway. The tomatoes were an extra because I love actual tomatoes in my spaghetti sauce! Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t get the sight of the rotten tomato pieces (yes, it was more than 1 and I was so upset that I didn\u2019t think to get a picture which is shameful on my part as a reviewer.) As an aside, I will say that because I didn\u2019t take a picture that anyone could disregard this review. I\u2019m not saying that people shouldn\u2019t purchase this product because it\u2019s a decent product. I\u2019m saying that when you make a sauce you shouldn\u2019t ever just drop ingredients in directly from a canned food.\nI have purchased this item a few times and it is what it is. I\u2019ve used it for making sandwiches and sauces and the thing with the rotten part happens with any canned food and you\u2019re bound to bump into that just as a calculation of the odds don\u2019t you think. It\u2019s a good product. Just use a bowl. And you can always talk to customer service for a refund if you want because the customer care is awesome as always."},

It's no where near as good as the diced tomatoes. What seemed a misfortune turned into a blessing. The diced tomatoes might even be healthier than the sauce."},
