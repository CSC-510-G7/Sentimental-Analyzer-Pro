    "Review": "I bought this for my mother. She doesn\u2019t need all the extras so I saw the price on this and definitely went for it! She\u2019s in her 70s and needs it for getting on the Internet and Facebook and keeping in touch with her friends and of course, her pictures and videos. It has more than enough and I mean more than enough storage for what she needs it for. why spend all that money for all that storage when you don\u2019t need it? So happy with my purchase! And she is so thrilled because hers was only holding a charge for a couple of hours and now she\u2019s got this one and she\u2019s back on Facebook, and happier than ever!"

    "Review": "In the product summary there are clearly pictures of the Apple Pen and Apple keyboard.  Under \"About this item\", it includes a detailed description of the Apple pen and keyboard.  Then at the very end of that paragraph include a statement \"accessories not included\".  Why describe it in \"about this item\" if they are not included?  Why not add a case, a screen protector, and a backup battery in there and say \"not included\"?  It's a little odd...and a little misleading I think.  I looked up other iPads for sale and none of them included a description of accessories under \"about this item\" because they were not included.\nThat is my only criticism of the posting of the item.  Other than that, it was a good value for the money, scratch and dent free, and seemed to be operating perfectly.  It arrived fast (same day) which is good because I needed it quickly for a work project."

    "Review": "I use my iPad all the time since I don\u2019t have a computer. My old one was at least six years old and the battery was pretty much gone and I had to keep it plugged in all the time to be able to use it. I had been putting off replacing it but decided the time and price were right. It\u2019s easy to set up a replacement because all my stuff is in my Icloud account. I highly recommend getting this model next time it\u2019s on special. Apple has some great deals when newer models are released."

    "Review": "This Apple \ud83c\udf4e iPad 9th generation is very competent and does everything I want it to do.  I don\u2019t do anything really super complicated with it (mostly streaming \ud83c\udfa5 movies, surfing \ud83c\udfc4\u200d\u2642\ufe0f the net, and of course, \u270d\ufe0f writing product reviews \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1b\ud83d\ude06) so it\u2019s fine for my needs.  Without a case, it\u2019s just over a pound (so not that heavy).  It has fast connectivity and is intuitively, user-friendly.  The \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f retina display touchscreen is a pretty decent size at 10.2 inches (diagonally).  The touchscreen is sharp, vivid, true to color, and very responsive.  Also, this iPad came with a 20W USB-C power adapter, USB-C to lightning charge cable, and 3 months free Apple TV+.  The Apple TV+ is great because I have been able to watch the \u26bd\ufe0f soccer/football\u26bd\ufe0f show, Ted Lasso, for FREE.  \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d  Score!!!!!  \u26bd\ufe0f\ud83e\udd45\u26bd\ufe0f  Apple \ud83c\udf4f makes excellent, quality electronics, and this handheld computer is absolutely no exception.  \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf4f\ud83d\ude03\ud83c\udf4e  The only things I wish were different about this iPad are the slow charging speed and the battery drains a little faster than I would like.  I use the iPad while it\u2019s charging and that slows down the charging speed.  I purchased this iPad for about $200 plus tax (free shipping, on sale, and had a gift card too).  I would like to buy the 10th generation iPad, but it\u2019s just too pricey and expensive for me.  This is a much more budget-friendly option.  Long story short, I really like this iPad and am very happy with this purchase.  Because of its excellent qualities, it\u2019s going to be very useful to me, and I think \ud83e\udd14 it will last a long time.  I am impressed by it and highly recommend it (especially if money is a factor).  \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf4f\ud83e\udd2a\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude03\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf4f\ud83d\ude0e\ud83e\udd14\ud83c\udf4f\ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude1d\u2b50\ufe0f\ud83e\ude77\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc4d"

    "Review": "For over a decade, I thought anyone who spent the money on an iPad was an idiot.  I bought one Android tablet after another because they were cheap and \"just as good\".  But each one didn't last long before running so slow I had to replace it.  Meanwhile, my old iPhone 5 was still working great as a music and sleep machine audio device for our bedroom.  I finally decided to step up to THIS iPad back in 2021.  WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG!!!!!!  First, it is still blazingly fast and will be for basic tasks like I use it for a decade or more.  I won't have to replace this for a very very long time.  Second.....the user experience is incredible, just like an iPhone or Macbook.  I'm cheap, but wish I hadn't tried to save money buying all those garbage low end Android tablets over the years."

    "Review": "It is a new iPad, in an unopened box. Would not expect it to be anything other than great Apple quality, which it is. My ONLY complaint with this order is that it took about 2 weeks to be delivered rather than a couple of days. I\u2019m sure that has something to do with logistics and how Amazon buys stock and sells genuine Apple new (rather than \u201crefreshed\u201d) electronics and there was no huge rush, just a disconnect between the usual Amazon speed of fulfillment and the experience with this purchase. Nevertheless, the savings made it all worth it. And I love my new iPad."

For $40 more I could buy an IPad 9th Gen so I went for it. Now I'm hearing how much better the new IPad is compared to the old mini 4. Extremely happy with this purchase. If you are in the same predicament go for the IPad 9th Gen. Mini-4 (2015) refurbished $208, 9th Gen (2021-22) brand new $249"

It was an old model for sure but it has been working out perfectly for my 8yo who received it for Christmas last year right before she turned 8! It was such a reasonable price and she was starting to outgrow the fire kids tablets we had purchased when she was between the ages of 2 and 7 yo."

    "Review": "My old Ipad Pro hasn\u2019t worked for over a year and I also needed a new computer -  but didn\u2019t need anything as sophisticated as a Mac so thought I would try out this 9th Gen Ipad.  So far it does most of what I would do with a larger laptop and has a touchscreen.  I was reluctant to buy Apple tech for quite a few years until I bought a small Iphone SE about 4 years ago - switched from a Samsung Galaxy..  The SE was a great size to carry around the city and it fit in most pockets and had great reception.  It was and still is a great piece of technology.  I upgraded to a 12 after 2 years and still use the SE around the house because it connects to wifi.  The 12 had a better camera and I had toddler granddaughters and after another 2 years I upgraded to the 14 PROMax which has a great camera, larger screen and is not unlike the SE except the bigger size to view photos.  I really love the touchscreen feature for NYTimes games and other interactive apps.  I worry about having most of my pictures on this technology because they could move to a more sophisticated system and make these obsolete - which is a concern. My daughter\u2019s Iphone 13 fell in the snow a few years ago and she somehow lost all her pictures that she thought were in the cloud.  I held on to my 12 because it holds quite a bit of what she lost since we shared their photos.  Neither of us is sure why this happened and if it could happen again.  If I have a stand alone camera it isn\u2019t convenient but I have the photos detached from the technology and the whims of a large multinational behemoth.  So far I am happy with the Ipad and am still learning how to use it.  I found a case that closes securely and  can stand in portrait or landscape mode which is really nice when viewing Netflix or AppleTV.  If you need a new computer to carry conveniently this Ipad is the way to go unless you really need the power and graphic abilities of the MAC.  My Iphone 14maxpro has 256g of memory and I barely use 100 so I thought I would only need 64g on the Ipad since my phone has the extra capacity.  Not convinced this was a great decision but some of my Iphone content can stay there exclusively  so it might just work out.  Or not\u2026.."

She loves the display and the battery longevity compared to her 2 android tablets. She also uses the iPad from time to time to take notes and to doodle and has had no complaints. All in all this tablet is more than powerful enough for what she and most iPad owners do. The display is beautiful, the sound is adequate and\nit has all the connectivity she needs. All in all a great Apple product that is now part of her commute bag.\nHope this was helpful!"

It also accepts the apple pencil 1st generation which works quite good. I love to use it in class especially to plan my coursers and note taking. It is really lighter to carry too."

    "Review": "I\u2019ve wanted an iPad for awhile, but the price was just too high.  It was hard to justify since I didn\u2019t need it for work - just for fun. The uncertainty surrounding buying refurbished kept me from buying for awhile but the other good reviews gave me the courage to take a chance.  I am soooo glad I did!  It looks and acts like a brand new iPad. It even came in a iPad box with an OEM charger.  I could easily be convinced that I was sent a brand new one.  I\u2019ve since bought 2 more.  Only one came with a real box, packed like new, but all 3 of them work like new.  There are no dings or scratches and I was able to update them all to the most current iOS version.  The battery life is great - there doesn\u2019t appear to be any degradation to battery life at all.  I highly recommend this iPad and will probably purchase a couple more for other family members.  I think this surprising purchase was my favorite buy of the year!"

    "Review": "This 9th gen iPad is the best value for money, at around two hundred fifty bucks on sale.\nIf you're willing to spend about twice as much, or four times as much for the Pro,  go for those instead.\nI'm not much of an iOS user, but I wanted to be in the Apple eco-system for certain apps not on Android. So this iPad is it, and I'm happy with the operation and performance and battery life."

    "Review": "This is my first Apple device. I have always felt their products were overpriced. Now in our economy everything is overpriced. The iPad is the only Apple device that I have even considered purchasing. I have several other brand tablets/laptops but just couldn't pass this up because of the good price. After hearing people praise Apple devices over other brands, there was a lot of hype to live up to. Bottom line, it was a little underwhelming, because of the hype. Taking the device at face value though, this is an excellent device. The pros: the processor and the battery life. I've been using it for over a month. This is the entry level iPad 9th gen but the A13 bionic chip is fast and able to handle multitasking very easily. Granted I only use this device really for entertainment(games, watching videos), browsing the web, checking emails, so I don't use it all day/every day. The battery lasts me a couple of days without charging. Even after watching videos for several hours I still don't have to charge it. The bezels make holding the device easier without blocking the screen. And because of it's 4:3 aspect ratio compared to other tablets 16:10 it makes watching videos/reading a more pleasant experience. I did buy a third party pencil to use with it. It works well for taking notes, there is a audible tap when using the pencil. I don't have any cons-the gestures take some getting used to. I just prefer other brands gestures, they seem more intuitive and useful to me. The screen is nice but it's not noticeably better than any of my other devices. Again this is the entry level iPad so for the price I think this is an excellent device. It should be able to handle most things you throw at it. I recommend this product and I'm glad I bought it."

I love that swipe in touchscreen capability makes navigating Internet documents very easy. Also, they have some great new features with the ability to edit messages after you send them how cool is that? It is a great device. I recommend it for not just students or executives. I highly recommend this device for anyone that\u2019s never used an electronic device. It\u2019s very easy to navigate very easy to use. I think you\u2019ll be happy with your purchase."

    "Review": "I purchased this IPad tablet for the Point of Sale in my wife's store. As her very inexpensive IT guy my research indicated it will work perfectly as we transition from QuickBooks to Shopify based front end sales. The screen is crisp, bright and loads quickly.  Set up was easy. I will add to this review if anything comes up (good or bad) as we become familiar with Apple (we are android or Microsoft in everything else). We shifted to Apple because the consensus in the Shopify community is that it works better for this application."

    "Review": "I always loved ipad, and this one definitely is the best you can get for the money you pay, good battery life, good screen performance and size, charges fast, and for my personal use is enough. I hesitate a lot buy this one or 10th gen or Air 5th but all of them give me exactly the same for my daily use so I buy the 9th and save. Also this uses lightning cable same that my currrent iphone and airpods so gets an ipad with usb-c cable wasn\u2019t ideal for me right now. So keep that in mind too in your purchase."

    "Review": "My previous iPad still operates [testimony to Apple\u2019s amazing quality] but it is so old (2012 3rd Gen) it will only run a couple of the apps I enjoy using.  I had stopped using it years ago and grew accustomed to using my iPhone and multiple Mac computers instead.  However, several months back I decided to explore streaming music with a WiiM Pro and felt I needed a larger screen than my iPhone to control the WiiM and read about the music I was listening to via Qobuz.  So I decided to get a new iPad but didn\u2019t need a laptop replacement (i.e., lots of processing power), or cutting edge screen.  And I wanted a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d size.  At around $250 this 9th Gen iPad is a fantastic bargain.\nIt doesn\u2019t have the heft or quality feel of my 3rd Gen, which is made out of steel, but it seems well put together.  The screen is only a tiny, tiny bit better but for what I do the screen is fine.  It\u2019s plenty bright and responsive.  And, of course, it runs every app I choose to use flawlessly.  A few attributes blow me away, however.  Even with what\u2019s now a slightly older processor (A13) it is very fast.  Battery life is staggering.  This iPad is so satisfying, I have switched my usage away from my phone, and even my TV\u2019s to it.  It\u2019s fantastic as a control device for the WiiM, great for recreational web surfing, and I have been using it as a display device for Xfinity Stream to watch local TV.  It\u2019s also perfect for watching YouTube videos.\nIt\u2019s hard to emphasize enough what a screaming bargain this is now - mid 2013."

It works well and I do like the bigger screen. Setting it up from my iPhone was a bit tedious. The apps went all over the place. I still have to clean it up and move the Apps around.

    "Review": "So I really like this iPad. As far as the screen size, although it\u2019s larger than my old iPad really can\u2019t tell the difference which is fine. Bought it for the price and iPads I think are already just the perfect size for the intended purpose.  Also not much difference in screen quality, but that was also already good. Touch screen is responsive even with glass screen protector and battery life, also no change. Depending on what you\u2019re doing, just checking email- will last a week- surfing content- shopping, u tube, streaming, maybe 6-8hr. But what do you expect. Runs on a battery the harder it works the more battery it uses. No brained. My favorite thing was how easy it was to transfer all my stuff from my old iPad to the new one. And I\u2019m not a computer genius. It practically did it all by itself. It walks you through the whole process when you start your set up. The old iPad does have to have a specific operating system requirement, so like my 1st iPad from like 2009 probably wouldn\u2019t transfer over. So for the price I found this to be a good buy."

    "Review": "I\u2019ve never felt a quote so accurate. I\u2019m not an Apple guy tbh, I have an iPhone but if I had the chance I would immediately change it for an Android.\nBut for so many years I\u2019ve been looking for a tablet that could help me to do what I do in a better way. But I never expected that an iPad would help me with all that. This is by far a great product for me, great performance, beautiful screen, stunning battery life. I got a cheap Bluetooth keyboard and it works perfect, in fact, I\u2019m writing this review with that keyboard and it\u2019s working great, the iPad captures all the words I type and it feels like using a PC but waaaaay more portable.\nIf you\u2019re an student like me, you should definitely get this one, I\u2019m still not an Apple fan, but this is a great product, that makes me realize Apple rules when it\u2019s about tablets, like I said, I\u2019ve used plenty of Android tablets, but I\u2019ve never experienced something like this. And the best part? It includes a charger, you now how weird is that on these days?\nFor me 64gb it\u2019s more than enough, however, I would definitely recommend you to get the 256gb version, just in case. I feel this iPad will be with me a very long time. Also, get a keyboard and a cheap stylus to touch the screen and I promise you the experience you\u2019ll get through this device will be great."

    "Review": "I have owned several iPads over the years and upgraded to this model after the new, highly over priced, iPad 10th generation model was released, Biggest gripe is this has the shortest battery life of any model I ever owned. Also, it will extremely slow if you use older charge cables so you must only use the newer cable. Aside from the poor battery life, this is a good product except that the screen is reflective, unlike iPads of a few generations earlier. The reflective screen was introduced a few years ago to help leverage the user to spend a lot more. Without lights in the background, the reflective screen is not a big issue, with lights it can be a minor annoyance."

    "Review": "The iPad9 design is outdated. It doesn't use the latest full-screen and narrow-bezel technology, and still uses round-dot buttons for a relatively modest appearance and low screen-to-body ratio. This is really intolerable, and at a glance you can tell it's not from this era. iPad9's A13 chip is actually okay, but the 3GB of RAM is really too small in today's eyes.But if you're just looking for a tablet to watch videos on, it does do the job perfectly well"

This ipad was affordable and works for everything I need it too and more. I was thrilled to find one that was what I needed and in a price range I could manage. Thank you SO much for providing me with what I have always dreamed for in an apple product. FYI the apple pen first Gen works with this iPad. I had to research a lot before purchasing one and I wanted to make sure it was compatible and it is the only one of the apple pens that works with this model."

    "Review": "I needed a basic iPad that would work for my small children and not cost me an arm and a leg. This is Apple's cheapest model and we are very embedded in their ecosystem so when it was on sale we bought it. It's exactly what we needed since we don't load a lot of apps for them, just streaming ones and a bunch of games. The screen looks great and best of all it works with the 1st gen Apple Pencil, which is a life saver as the kids love using coloring apps with it and will do it for an extended period of time.\nIf you're looking for a basic iPad for your children or aging parents, I think this is a great buy, especially if you can get it a bit cheaper when it's on sale."

    "Review": "Purchased this iPad for my 4yr old grandson.  He seemed to have grown out of his AMAZON tablet and he was always wanting his sisters iPad.  So, had to break down and buy him his own iPad.  This was an EXCELLENT price on AMAZON!  He loves it, he and his sister can play games together."

Looks really good and works really well for my elderly parents so it was really easy for them to learn from it since they have iPhones really smooth when moving within apps, I have no complaints."

    "Review": "My 5 year old iPad was ready to give up the ghost so after some research decided to buy the 9th gen. instead of the new 10. Everything I read pretty much said that unless you're doing really challenging tasks the processor in the 9th was more than adequate. On sale this was $150.00 less than the 10th gen. so it was a no brainer. Arrived on time (thanks Amazon) factory fresh. Works perfectly as I would expect; quicker and better screen quality than my old one. A great buy."

    "Review": "As far as apple products go I aways like getting the cheaper stuff, it works great and feels high quality. That's exactly this tablet, amazon apple products tend to go on sale and yet theres nothing wrong or different about them compared to buying directly from apple. highly recommended that you buy apple products from amazon because apple products never go on sale from the apple stores or website. and this is a brand new tablet you are buying, from apple.\nTLDR version: it's a great tablet! genuine brand new apple product!"

    "Review": "This is my fourth iPad since 2011. The old ones still work fine, but eventually run out of memory and get passed down to my grandkids.\nThis time I bit the bullet and bought the maximum amount of storage available. I now have enough memory to download movies for use on long airplane trips.\nDo yourself a favor, don't cheap out on memory, buy the max and these things will last forever.\nThe only time I had a problem with any of my iPads was when I hit it with a Weed Wacker and destroyed the screen. Cost me a couple hundred dollars to replace, but it's still going strong. Like a Timex, it takes a wacking and keeps on working."

    "Review": "This replaced ipad 5th generation, so the screen is larger & appears to be easier to view. Other than that they are pretty much identical in physical appearance, of course 9th gen has a faster chip along with a few more advanced features, camera/apps, etc. I mostly use it for surfing internet & games & would definitely buy it again. I didn\u2019t like the fact that the stowage went from 64GB to 256GB skipping the normal 128 GB & going to 256 GB was too pricey for my intended use."

    "Review": "I am a first time iPad owner. Have been using my iPhone to surf the net, send email and messages, etc. Found this iPad 9th Gen at a great bargain on Amazon Prime day. Couldn\u2019t be more happy with the purchase. It does everything I want it to and its larger screen is so much easier to view than my iPhone. Only downside is the smaller 64 GB storage. Could have upgraded, but the price would have been considerably higher. Very happy with the purchase, and would definitely recommend."

    "Review": "I have had my iPad 9th Generation 64GB Wi-Fi since the end of November, 2022. It has been about 5 months. I upgraded from an iPad Air 2 32GB Wi-Fi (2014 model) that I had for almost 6 years! I have to say that there is a reason why Apple iPads are sold at such a premium price. That's because they provide valuable practical use for far longer than the vast majority of what is available in the tablet market.\nWith that said the 2021 iPad 9th Generation is a base iPad with a limited amount of fancy features and a dated iPad design. Quite frankly, I actually use my iPad on the go and all of the iPads I have had go directly into an Otterbox Defender case. So I hardly notice the little aesthetics in design when my iPads area always in an Otterbox Defender case.\nI won't make this review long and will highlight the particular reason why I feel the need to write this review at all. I would say there's three top reasons why I believe the iPad 9th generation is excellent: 1. Good CPU performance/64GB base memory capacity, 2. Value pricing, and 3. Apple Pencil/Freeform.\n1. CPU performance is good with the A13 CPU from the iPhone 11. I am confident that I will be able to use this iPad for at least 4 more years, if not 5. I bought my iPad Air 2 (2014 model) in 2016 and it was supported with OS updates up until iPadOS 15, which is a total of 8 years. But the iPad Air 2 was among the longest supported iPads in Apple's tablet history. So it is not likely to be repeated. But I think that the iPad 9th generation should be supported for at least 6 years, 2021 to 2027. Plus, the 64GB base capacity is excellent for my basic use of the iPad.\n2. The pricing for the iPad 9th Generation 64GB retails at $329.99, but it is often for sale at $269.99. That's how much I purchased it for during Cyber Monday 2022. It has been on sale for as low as $249.99 at some other retailers as well. So overall, the pricing is very affordable for a device this capable with support for many years to come.\n3. I know that the Apple Pencil has been out for years, but I have only now tried it. It was not supported with my iPad Air 2 (2014 model) and I never gave it much thought as being useful to me. I always thought that the Apple Pencil was geared towards artists, which to some extent it is. I tried the Apple Pencil on my iPad 9th Generation about a month after getting mine. It was a revolutionary experience for me. I have been looking for a viable substitute for a whiteboard for the longest time. But there is not any real replacement for what you can do on a whiteboard. The Apple Pencil with FreeForm is the closest that I've come to the experience I get on a whiteboard. Although, I do still use a 4'x8' whiteboard for some brainstorming sessions, the Apple Pencil has afforded me to do some basic brainstorming in FreeForm. This is a massive benefit and I can only see Apple getting better with its FreeForm app. Not to mention app developers releasing new apps to take advantage of the Apple Pencil for brainstorming on a virtual whiteboard.\nOverall, I highly recommend the iPad 9th Generation."

    "Review": "Has lots of storage for all my toddlers games. Easy to find and has a very large bulky size but hey she doesn\u2019t carry it far enough to break it. So we leave it where she lays. Could have got the mini but been burned by how easy that was to carry with my first kiddo. Too heavy to hold up that\u2019s the only downfall. So she leans down if holding but everyone does that anyways. We just prop it up and when she\u2019s tired she rolls away from it at night. Because she\u2019s not holding it so close to her face she stays on it a way more appropriate amount of time for a kid."
