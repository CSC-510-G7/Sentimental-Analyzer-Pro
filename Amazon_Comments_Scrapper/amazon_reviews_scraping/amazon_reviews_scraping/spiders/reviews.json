I found that these diced tomatoes taste way better than a spaghetti sauce. Slice up some of your favorite fresh toppings, and these tomatoes are super yummy on a pizza. I only discovered this because I was out of my favorite spaghetti sauce and I just used these for the heck of it (I was craving pizza). I won't go back to spaghetti sauce now. It's no where near as good as the diced tomatoes. What seemed a misfortune turned into a blessing. The diced tomatoes might even be healthier than the sauce."},
