First upload your software to CalechDATA, and then click on the blue DOI badge on the right hand side of the record. You'll get a list of badge code that you can copy into your GitHub repository. You can also use the InvenioRDM GitHub Archiver (IGA) , which creates metadata records and sends releases automatically from GitHub to CaltechDATA. It replaces and enhances the GitHub integration that was previously available in CaltechDATA. You can set up IGA as a GitHub Action in your repository by following these instructions, or if you email your GitHub repository to data@caltech.edu we'll directly make a pull request with the configuration.
