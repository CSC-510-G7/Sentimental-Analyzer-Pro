This time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that the IDF will wipe Hamas "off the face of the Earth." But Israeli officials have been less forthcoming on who or what will replace the Islamist militant group.

"There are four options," Yaakov Amidror, who served as Netanyahu's national security adviser from 2011 to 2013, told Newsweek in an interview, as the Israeli ground offensive looms. All paths, Amidror said, include a punishing Gaza campaign.

"I would even dare to say that no one would forgive the government if it will not be ended with a huge ground forces attack on Gaza," he explained.
