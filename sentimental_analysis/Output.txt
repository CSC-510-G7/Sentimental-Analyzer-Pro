I don't usually write reviews on items I purchase from Amazon, but I was quite disappointed with this 
cologne purchase from Amazon. I purchased this item a few months ago for my son because he really 
love this cologne. After a few use and traveling with the bottle, it started leaking and the labeling started 
peeling. He also complained that the scent doesn't last long. I have various cologne from different 
manufacturers and I can tell the original scent by how long the smell stays on your clothes..I am greatly 
disappointed and won't be buying any more fragrance from amazon..
