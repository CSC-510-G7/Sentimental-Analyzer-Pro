I have various cologne from different manufacturers and I can tell the original scent by how long the smell stays on your clothes..I am greatly disappointed and won't be buying any more fragrance from amazon..\n\n  \n"},

I do not believe this to be an  authentic Dolce and Gabbana product. If I could return it I would. Very disappointed in Amazon for offering something of such poor quality. Will buy from a reputable store in the future. Big waste of money. And they get one star because it's required to submit a review. I would like to add that Amazon stood behind their sale and provided a full refund.\n\n  \n"},

Its gone.Even if it was a EDT it would last for an hour but this says its a EDP, it should last for a good 3 to 4 hours.The real PROOF is when you go to RETURN IT. What a surprise you cant return it. I don't think ill ever order a fragrance from AMAZON again.I encourage you not to spend your hard earned money on this product\n\n  \n"},

I purchased this item a few months ago for my son because he really love this cologne. After a few use and traveling with the bottle, it started leaking and the labeling started peeling. He also complained that the scent doesn't last long. I have various cologne from different manufacturers and I can tell the original scent by how long the smell stays on your clothes..I am greatly disappointed and won't be buying any more fragrance from amazon..\n\n  \n"},

He also complained that the scent doesn't last long. I have various cologne from different manufacturers and I can tell the original scent by how long the smell stays on your clothes..I am greatly disappointed and won't be buying any more fragrance from amazon..\n\n  \n"},

Its gone.Even if it was a EDT it would last for an hour but this says its a EDP, it should last for a good 3 to 4 hours.The real PROOF is when you go to RETURN IT. What a surprise you cant return it.

I do not believe this to be an  authentic Dolce and Gabbana product. If I could return it I would. Very disappointed in Amazon for offering something of such poor quality. Will buy from a reputable store in the future. Big waste of money. And they get one star because it's required to submit a review. I would like to add that Amazon stood behind their sale and provided a full refund.\n\n  \n"},

Its gone.Even if it was a EDT it would last for an hour but this says its a EDP, it should last for a good 3 to 4 hours.The real PROOF is when you go to RETURN IT. What a surprise you cant return it. I don't think ill ever order a fragrance from AMAZON again.I encourage you not to spend your hard earned money on this product\n\n  \n"},

I purchased this item a few months ago for my son because he really love this cologne. After a few use and traveling with the bottle, it started leaking and the labeling started peeling. He also complained that the scent doesn't last long. I have various cologne from different manufacturers and I can tell the original scent by how long the smell stays on your clothes..I am greatly disappointed and won't be buying any more fragrance from amazon..\n\n  \n"},
