[{"Summary": "Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) requires substantial computational resources for model training and inference, but the electronic-waste (e-waste) implications of GAI and its management strategies remain underexplored.\nHere we introduce a computational power-driven material flow analysis framework to quantify and explore ways of managing the e-waste generated by GAI, with a particular focus on large language models.\nOur findings indicate that this e-waste stream could increase, potentially reaching a total accumulation of 1.2\u20135.0 million tons during 2020\u20132030, under different future GAI development settings.\nMeanwhile, we show that the implementation of circular economy strategies along the GAI value chain could reduce e-waste generation by 16\u201386%.\nThis underscores the importance of proactive e-waste management in the face of advancing GAI technologies."}, {"Summary": "While more than a half-dozen billionaire money managers are
