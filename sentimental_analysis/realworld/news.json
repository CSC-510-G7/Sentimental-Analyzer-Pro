[{"Summary": "Sales of Tesla electric cars slipped from July through September after the company paused production at some factories to upgrade assembly lines.\nThe company delivered 435,000 vehicles worldwide in the third quarter, down from 466,000 in the second quarter.\nWall Street analysts had expected the decline, which they attributed to production slowdowns as Tesla refitted factories in the United States and China.\nStill, the dip in sales may renew concerns that demand for Tesla cars is slackening even after the company cut prices.\nIn China, Tesla is trying to fend off Chinese carmakers, like BYD and Nio, that are rolling out new models more quickly."}, {"Summary": "DETROIT \u2014 Despite a steady stream of new models from a number of automakers, sales this year of electric and hybrid vehicles have failed to keep pace with the growth in the overall American market.\nBut if the market for electrified cars was slumbering, Tesla Motors woke it up with a jolt Thursday with the unveiling of its coming Model 3 lineup of affordable, zero-emission vehicles.\nGiven that electric and hybrid vehicles account for only about 2 percent of last year\u2019s record-setting sales in the United States, the extraordinary reaction to Tesla\u2019s first mass-market model was a vivid demonstration of the potential demand in the segment.\n\u201cIt shows that the future of electric vehicles is not necessarily bleak,\u201d said Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with the research firm Kelley Blue Book.\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ve been waiting for the right products that resonate with consumers.\u201d"}, {"Summary": "That\u2019s quite a bit longer than it takes to pump 15 gallons of gasoline, but at Supercharger stations Tesla pays for the electricity, which seems a reasonable trade for fast, silent and emissions-free driving.\nThe Model S has won multiple car-of-the-year awards and is, many reviews would have you believe, the coolest car on the planet.\nAfter 49 minutes, the display read \u201ccharge complete,\u201d and the estimated available driving distance was 242 miles.\nAs I crossed into New Jersey some 15 miles later, I noticed that the estimated range was falling faster than miles were accumulating.\nAt 68 miles since recharging, the range had dropped by 85 miles, and a little mental math told me that reaching Milford would be a stretch."}, {"Summary": "The outcome is a major win for Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, who has forcefully promoted the car\u2019s technological prowess and ability to prevent accidents.\nThe crash on May 7, 2016, attracted widespread attention and threatened to sidetrack the company\u2019s push toward autonomous vehicles.\nThe regulators warned, however, that advanced driver-assistance systems like the one in Tesla\u2019s cars could be relied on to react properly in only some situations that arise on roadways.\nAnd the officials said that all automakers needed to be clear about how the systems should be used.\nAlmost all major automakers are pursuing similar technology."}, {"Summary": "DETROIT \u2014 Orders keep rolling in for the forthcoming Model 3 from Tesla Motors, which said on Thursday that it had received $1,000 deposits for more than 325,000 of its newest electric cars.\nThe extraordinary response to the vehicle, which will not even be built until late next year, underscored the demand among consumers for a mass-market electric car that carries Tesla\u2019s luxury-brand cachet.\nTesla said in a blog post that the number of reservations corresponded to about $14 billion in future sales, and was a milestone in the company\u2019s growth.\n\u201cThis has been a true grass-roots effort driven by the passion of the Tesla team that\u2019s worked so hard to this point, and our current and future customers who believe so strongly in what we are trying to achieve,\u201d the company said."}, {"Summary": "FREMONT, Calif. \u2014 After a meteoric rise that made it, at least briefly, the most valuable car company in America, Tesla arrived at a moment of truth on Friday night as it delivered the first of its mass-market sedans to their new owners.\nFor a decade, the company has been a manufacturer of high-end electric cars in small numbers.\nBut now, Tesla is aiming at much loftier goals.\nIt wants not only to become a large-scale producer in the suddenly crowded field of battery-powered vehicles but also to lure consumers away from mainstream, gasoline-powered automobiles.\nTesla unveiled its new Model 3 sedans, starting at $35,000, in a ceremony on Friday night on the grounds of its sprawling assembly plant and research facility outside San Francisco."}, {"Summary": "Of the Model 3s assembled in the fourth quarter, Tesla delivered 1,550 to customers, although many of the initial recipients were employees of the company.\nIn a statement, Tesla reported \u201cmajor progress addressing Model 3 production bottlenecks,\u201d adding that the production rate increased \u201csignificantly\u201d toward the end of the quarter.\nIn the last few days, it said, the company was nearing an assembly rate that would produce 1,000 Model 3s a week.\nIn addition to the Model 3, Tesla also delivered 15,200 Model S sedans and 13,120 Model X sport-utility vehicles in the fourth quarter.\nIt said overall deliveries were 27 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of 2016."}, {"Summary": "Tesla\u2019s New Plaid Model Is Ready.\nThat Should Help the Stock."}, {"Summary": "Tesla said on Wednesday that it would build a factory in Mexico to manufacture an electric vehicle that would be significantly more affordable than any of the cars it sold now.\nBut the company disappointed investors who were expecting it to make big announcements about new products and strategies.\nThe message was that Tesla is eons ahead of other automakers in technology and efficiency, on track to someday produce 20 million vehicles a year, twice as many as Toyota does now.\nTesla provided few of the financial bullet points or strategic initiatives that are often found in investor presentations.\nElon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, portrayed Tesla as a company on a mission to eliminate global dependence on fossil fuels, a theme he has often highlighted."}, {"Summary": "Tesla said last month it was working on readying its Austin, Texas, plant to build the new model with \u201cearly production\u201d set to start in the middle of 2023.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the final lap for Cybertruck,\u201d Musk told a conference call with financial analysts.\nTesla may have to significantly redesign the Cybertruck batteries to switch to conventional 2170 batteries, he added.\nThe company has pushed back production timing three times since: from late 2021 to late 2022, then to early 2023 and most recently to the mid-2023 target for initial production.\nIn January, Musk had cited shortages in sourcing components as the reason for pushing the launch of Cybertruck into 2023."}]
