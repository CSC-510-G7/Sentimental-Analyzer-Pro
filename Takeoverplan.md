Group 1 Project 1 takeover plan.

Commiting Policy updates:

Looking at the commiting.md we plan to update the policy on how the group will use branching and how we plan on comminting code due to the loose standards that were inheretied.
The group will develope with a git flow workflow, where each group member will work in parralell on a development branch for their feature they are working on. The testing czar
will supervise the branching devopment and make sure that the testing of each implemted feature exists and passes before getting merged back in.

Testing updates:

The project is lacking a automated testing suite, style checkers, formating guide, code coverage and other useful tools for testing, especialy going into project 3. We plan to
desginate a "Testing Czar" who will be in charge of implemtning automated testing and helping to ensure proper test cases exist to througly test the codebase.

Orginzational Updates: In effort to better stay orgnized we will be using a project board to better keep track of tasks. Additonly issues will be created for larger problems and
referenced in tasks due the the feedback given in the Project 1 review.

Coding tasks:

Coding issues have been imported form the previous groups project and have been assigned to team members to take care of. 
- Mita and Prasanth who have data science backgrounds will focus on issues related to the machine learning and data science backend of the codebase
- Suyash and Matthew will work on issues related to front end user designs
- Matthew will handel areas relatated to security and user authentication.
- abhi will serve as the Testing czar
