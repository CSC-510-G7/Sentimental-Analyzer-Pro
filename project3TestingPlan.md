For project 3, we have created a setup that will be used to check our sentiment analyzer for accuracy. We have provided a python test script that will randomly assign and order diffrent sources for input to the sentiment analyzer to diffrent testers. The tester will use a form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1G4PoOjU0QhYWLjxyXCoyjsAR6VFAB-GflxHq7iLdkq0/edit) to then quantifiy each source for its sentiment. These results can be averaged across diffrent testers and then statistical tests can be used to compare the sentiment ranking that humans averaged each input to what our analyzer predicted it to be. Both the script and source can be tailored to the inherted groups needs.
