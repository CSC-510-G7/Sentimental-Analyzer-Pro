Mumbai-headquartered TCS saw a reduction of 6,333 employees, while Noida-headquartered HCLTech reported a decrease of 2,299 employees.\n\nAll three IT giants also saw their voluntary attrition levels moderating to around 14 per cent\u2014a contrast to the 20 per cent-plus attrition witnessed two years ago at the peak of the tech talent war. The opening up of plethora of tech opportunities in the wake of pandemic-led digitisation of organisations saw tech employees negotiating multiple job offers and exorbitant joining hikes. And tech organisations witnessed high offer dropout rates.\n\nNow, however, the scenario has changed considerably as the IT majors have cut revenue growth forecasts for the ongoing financial year. Infosys cut its revenue guidance for 2023-24 to 1-2.5 per cent compared to the 1-3.5 per cent given earlier. HCLTech has reduced revenue growth guidance for the full year in the range of 5-6 per cent from 6-8 per cent projected at the end of June 2023 quarter due to its below-expectation performance during the first half of the current fiscal.\n\nPointing to a significant fresher bench that is being trained on Gen AI, Infosys CFO Nilanjan Roy said the company is not looking to make fresh campus hires yet this year.\n\nHCL Tech CEO & MD C Vijaykumar said in the earnings call that the recruitment part has reduced because they hired many freshers. The Noida firm, which added 3,630 freshers during the quarter, said it plans to hire 10,000 freshers this year compared to around 27,000 freshers it recruited in 2022-23.\n\nOn the people front, TCS CEO N Krithivasan had said in an analyst call after Q2 result declaration: \u201cWe continue to have the right talent, but have recalibrated our gross hiring to ensure better utilisation of our existing capacity.\u201d The firm\u2019s CHRO Milind Lakkad pointed out that they invested in fresh talent for the past 18 months. \u201cThat investment is now paying off. And as a result, and also because of lower attrition, we kind of recalibrated our gross hiring and those numbers are less than our attrition.

The headcount in Q2FY24 was down by 7,186 employees.\n\nMilind Lakkad, CHRO of the company, attributed this to the company's recalibration of its hiring targets.\n\n\u201cOur strategy of proactively hiring bright freshers and investing in training them with the right skills is paying off. With that talent coming on stream and with reduced attrition, we were able to recalibrate our gross additions, keeping it below the departures during the quarter, driving up productivity and enhancing project outcomes,\u201d Lakkad explained.\n\nInfosys\n\nInfosys reported a net fall of 7,530 employees in its headcount sequentially.\n\nInfosys has 3,28,764 employees on its roll as of September 2023, as per its quarterly results.

The headcount is down 16,454 YoY.\n\nInfosys has also slowed down on hiring, and will not conduct mass recruiting drives across Indian college campuses, CFO Nilanjan Roy noted during the post results press conference. He explained that the company has a significant bench size, because of which hiring plans have been put on the back-burner.\n\n\u201cCompany is not going to campuses as yet.

The company\u2019s headcount in Q1 had dropped by 2,506.\n\nCEO and MD C Vijayakumar explained that the headcount at the company went down since freshers on the bench or in training were ready to be put on projects.\n\nHe said, \"Our employee count decreased by 1 percent on a sequential basis because we consciously didn't backfill attrition as a lot of freshers we hired in the last 18 months are now ready to be deployed.\"\n\nSector overview\n\nThree major IT companies have released their results so far.

It completely overshadowed other positives from the Salil Parekh-led firm's earnings.\n\nIf an overnight 7 per cent fall in Infosys American depositary receipts (ADR) is any hint, Infosys shares are likely to see a steep fall as the market opens on Friday. This could be a similar fall that the stock witnessed post Q1 results.\n\nMotilal Oswal Securities insisted FY24 guidance cut was surprising but not material. It said Infosys' dollar revenues at $4.72 billion and CC sequential revenue growth at 2.3 per cent QoQ were ahead of its estimates. This was primarily due to a one-time pass-through revenue gain of 160 basis points.\n\nLarge deal total contract value (TCV) at $7.7 billion was the highest ever, as Infosys won four mega deals during the quarter. Besides, a 40 basis points margin improvement during the quarter was encouraging and indicated Infosys' ability to manage workforce, analysts said.\n\n\"However, despite the strong revenue beat and deal inflow, Infosys surprisingly lowered the upper end of its FY24 revenue growth guidance to 1.0-2.5 per cent YoY CC from 1-3.5 per cent YoY CC earlier, attributing it to continued weakness in discretionary spends and a delay in mega deal scale-up to FY25,\" Motilal Oswal said while suggesting a share price target of Rs 1,660 on the stock.\n\n\"A gap down opening in the Rs 1,400-1,420 range could be seen in the opening trade,\u201d said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP for Research at Mehta Equities.\n\nInfosys indicated volume compression in base business, cutting of discretionary spending and postponement of discretionary spends and late start dates on new projects won as reasons for guidance cut. Its management expects revenue decline in Q3 due to seasonality and Q4 to be driven by completion of a large deal. It, though, retained its margin guidance of 20\u201322 per cent.\n\nIf one includes TCS and HCL Technologies commentary, the expectation that the December quarter would be flat or show some mild growth sequentially has been belied, Nirmal Bang said adding that the results have likely led to consensus downgrading estimates.\n\n\"We have been negative on the stock and the sector for the last 18 months. We continue to be cautious even now as we believe the worst on the macro front is ahead of us and not behind us. We recently cut FY25 revenue/earnings for the entire sector as we believe our base case of a shallow US recession is pushed back into 2024,\" it said while suggesting a target of Rs 1,253 on the stock, valuing it at 10 per cent discount to TCS.\n\nSumit Pokharna, Research Analyst, Vice President at Kotak Securities said weak volumes have been fed into the guidance, which implies flat to 1.9 per cent decline in revenues in the next two quarters.\n\n\"The EBIT margin of 21.2 per cent was ahead of our estimate of 20.6 per cent despite higher pass-through revenues. While net headcount increased by 7.5K employees to 328.7K employee QoQ, the headcount decline on YoY comparison stands at 16.5K employees or 5 per cent. Employee utilisation of ex-trainees has increased, indicating that utilisation has scope to increase further,\" Pokharna said.\n\nDespite delivering better-than-expected results, Infosys trimmed its guidance, which is a reflection of it facing exceptionally higher ramp-downs than anticipated (higher than peers too), said Nuvama Institutional Equities.\n\n\"While the management alluded to strong deal-wins supporting FY25E growth, the weak exit rate of FY24 would mean FY25 growth is likely to be in mid-single digits. We continue to believe that Infosys is going through some company-specific issues (not to be seen as a read-across for the sector), exacerbated by weak macros.
